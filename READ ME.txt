Name: The Pacman Project

Description: this project was a coding assignment that I had to completed in which I was to make Pacman go from one side of the screen and bounce back and forth while changing images.

How to run: when you need a particular image to loop or move across the screen with certain boundaries this project highlights that.

Roadmap for future improvements: multiple directions for pacman to go in
