# Pacman
A Pacman Project I completed as a part of my coding eduction.
Name: The Pacman Project
Description: this project was a coding assignment that I had to completed in which I was to make Pacman go from one side of the screen and bounce back and forth while changing images.
Usage when you need a particular image to loop or move across the screen with certain boundaries this project highlights that.
